# Xanadu-Pennylane
For this challenge we provided a variational quantum circuit in PennyLane that depends on a set of trainable parameters. The circuit produces a single number as the expectation value of a fixed measurement.  The minimum expectation value of this circuit can be produced by optimizing its parameters.
